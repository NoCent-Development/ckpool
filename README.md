## Merged Mining settings

The following settings must be configured on `ckpool.conf` to do merged mining with RSK.

```
"rskd" :  [
	{
		"url" : "localhost:4444",
		"auth" : "user",
		"pass" : "pass"
	}
]
```
`url` is the address and port where the RskJ node is listening

`"rskpollperiod": 2` indicates the frequency in seconds to poll RskJ node for work.

`"rsknotifypolicy": 2` indicates when to trigger updates to miners. 
- 0 is only when a new bitcoin work is received 
- 1 is when an rsk work is received  
- 2 is the same as 1 but sending `clean_jobs` parameter from stratum protocol in `true`
